    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>The prince of Askr, Alphonse, was mouning the loss of his sister, Sharena.</p>
    <p>Then the prince was suddenly bombarded by a mystical dragon.</p>
    <p>The dragon, he assumed, was some kind of monster sent by the mistress of death herself, Hel. The dragon turned out to be a wyvern from the neighboring kingdom of Embla. The rider was the princess of Embla herself, Veronica. Normally, he and Veronica were on opposing terms, but now, she looked remorseful.</p>
